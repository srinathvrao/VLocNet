Wow - so empty. D:

This is where you store the folder for each scene in the dataset (fire, heads, office, etc.).

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/rgb-d-dataset-7-scenes/). Extract the scene you want to train on into this folder. Also make sure you extract each sequence in the scene!

You then set the scene to train on by modifying code/loadingdata.py.
